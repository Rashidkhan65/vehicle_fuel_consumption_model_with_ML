Vehicle Fuel Consumption Model with Machine Learning

Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict vehicle fuel consumption based on various input features. Predicting fuel consumption accurately can aid in optimizing fuel efficiency, reducing costs, and minimizing environmental impact. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can analyze historical data and extract patterns to build a predictive model.

Features
Machine Learning Algorithms: Utilize various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting to train the predictive model.

Data Preprocessing: Perform data preprocessing steps including data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for model training.

Feature Selection: Employ techniques like feature importance analysis to identify significant predictors of fuel consumption.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or random search.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a production environment, allowing users to make real-time predictions on fuel consumption.
